# CIS310-HW1


## Circuit Implementations

This repository contains implementations of logic circuits for a **4-bit adder** and a **2-bit multiplier**. These circuits were designed and tested in a logic simulator, and screenshots of the completed circuits are provided.

### Features:

- **2-Bit Multiplier:**
  - Multiplies two 2-bit binary numbers using AND gates and adders.
  - Efficient design verified through simulations.
    
- **4-Bit Adder:**
  - Implements a full adder logic without XOR gates.
  - Chains four full adders to handle 4-bit binary addition.
  - Includes test cases with corresponding results.
